Render Engine for Vuforia (QCAR)

- currently only for IOS and only OPENGLES 2.0

see ReadMe.pdf for installation & usage

I'm using 

-  ASSIMP http://assimp.sourceforge.net (for model-import; see: http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html)
- FREEIMAGE http://freeimage.sourceforge.net (for texture-loading; see: http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/features.html)



BTW: You'll find a lot of free 3D models (most as .3ds) at http://archive3d.net/
